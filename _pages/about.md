Hi there! I'm Amruta, I have worked as a SOC Analyst for a year and a half. My job is to ensure the security of a network by monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security alerts. I'm proficient in using ElasticSearch SIEM tool and had the opportunity to work on a client project that was entirely based on AWS. My strengths include documentation, communication and management skills. 

Moreover, I am continuously learning about web application security and aim to transition to VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) as I want to broaden my knowledge of all areas of cybersecurity.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy using my free time to read books and immerse myself in different life experiences.

Please feel free to explore this website and learn a little bit about me.
