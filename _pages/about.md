As a computer engineer graduate with more than one and a half years of experience working in SOC(Security Operations Center) and serving as a SPOC for a client, I have developed a strong understanding of security best practices and risk management. I am currently working as a Security Analyst and am responsible for identifying and addressing security issues, monitoring network traffic, and responding to security incidents.

Driven by a passion for advancing my expertise in red teaming, I am constantly sharpening my skills through hands-on lab exercises and CTFs. Beyond work, reading books is one of my favorite hobbies, rounding out my focus on both professional and personal growth.

With my proactive and adaptable approach, I am always ready to embrace new challenges and expand my knowledge. As a quick learner, I thrive in dynamic environments and continuously fine-tune my expertise to stay ahead of the curve. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! Whether you'd like to discuss potential collaboration or explore employment opportunities, or simply get to know me, I'd be happy for the chance to connect.
