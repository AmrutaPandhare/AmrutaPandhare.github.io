<p>Hi there! I’m Amruta, I have worked as a SOC Analyst for a year and a half. My job is to ensure the security of a network by monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security alerts. I’m proficient in using ElasticSearch SIEM tool for this purpose.</p>

<p>In my role, I keep a watchful eye on the network for any signs of an attack. If an attack is detected, I investigate and report it promptly. I also enjoy analyzing various log sources and developing use cases to improve our monitoring capabilities.</p>

<p>One of my strengths is documentation, which comes in handy when creating Threat Advisory reports that detail vulnerabilities, emerging threats, and other cybersecurity risks. To stay up to date with the latest trends in cybersecurity, I regularly consult Threat Intel.</p>

<p>I’ve also had the opportunity to work on a client project that was entirely based on AWS, which has helped me develop my expertise in this area. Additionally, my strong communication and management skills have been valuable assets in my interactions with clients and colleagues on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am continuously learning about web application security and aim to transition to VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) as I want to broaden my knowledge of all areas of cybersecurity.</p>
