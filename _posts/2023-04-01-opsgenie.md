## What is Opsgenie & How it works?

Opsgenie is a cloud-based incident management platform that helps teams respond to alerts and incidents quickly and efficiently. It offers a wide range of features such as alerting, on-call scheduling, incident management, and collaboration tools. 

Opsgenie works by receiving alerts from various sources such as monitoring tools, cloud services, and other applications. These alerts can be customized based on severity, priority, and other criteria. Once an alert is received, Opsgenie can notify the appropriate team members via various communication channels such as email, SMS, voice call, or mobile push notification. 

It also offers on-call scheduling, which helps teams manage their on-call rotations and ensure that the right person is notified in case of an incident. Additionally, it provides incident management capabilities such as incident response workflows, collaboration tools, and reporting and analytics. 

Overall, Opsgenie streamlines the incident management process and helps teams resolve incidents quickly and efficiently, improving overall uptime and reducing the impact of downtime on business operations.
